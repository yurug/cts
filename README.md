The supplementary material contains two parts:

- the formalized Coq proof, with pre-built documentation. Start by
  browsing the [online documentation](https://yurug.github.io/cts/) and/or
  `suppl-material/coqproof/Overview.v`.

  The formalization was last tested with Coq 8.8.1 and 8.8.2 and the Equations plugin version 1.1.

- the evaluation case studies and benchmarks, including raw data.
